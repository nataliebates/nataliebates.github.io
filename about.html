      <!-- Biography -->
      <p>
          Hello!
          My name is Natalie Bates. I was born in Pittsburgh, PA, I grew up in Fort Plain, NY along with my seven 
          (yes, seven) siblings, and I currently live in Syracuse, NY with my husband. I've been working as a software engineer 
          for a defense company called <a href="https://srcinc.com/" target="_blank">SRC, Inc.</a> for the past two years. I graduated in 
          2019 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.albany.edu/" target="_blank">University at Albany</a> 
          with minors in Informatics as well as Film Studies. Currently, in addition to working full-time, I am pursuing a 
          master's degree in Software Development from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> online, and expect 
          to complete the program in May 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the remainder of my free time, I like to cook elaborate meals, see whatever is showing at the movie theater, 
          practice hobby photography, and play games on my Nintendo Switch. I, along with my husband, am also working 
          on completing projects around our first house which we bought earlier this year. My idea of a fun Sunday involves 
          buying a cappuccino and then walking around Target trying not to spend too much money on home decor. The book 
          I'm currrently reading: <i>A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor</i> by Hank Green.
      </p>
